This is my PHP & MySQL Assignment in which I am using all the important CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality
**user.sql contains dummy data, taken from data http://www.generatedata.com/**
**functions.php contains all the functionalities used in this assignment**
Below are some of the questions for which I have written functions in this function.php file

1)Write a function to check if the primary key (user_id) that we are randomly
generating within the createnewuser function already exists. If it does, then
display the key on the screen. Continue your program by generating a new key
and inserting the user successfully. Also, display a message that the user was
successfully created and then display the newly created users record on the
screen. Use your HTML skills to make the records look pretty.

2)When inserting a new user, find out if the user already exists. The parameters to
match are firstname, lastname, email and birthdate. If all of them match –
display an error message that the user already exists and do not insert the
duplicate user.

3)Write a function to delete a user record (delete from table)

4)Write a function to FAKE delete a user. Like we discussed, the record stays but
to our eyes its deleted.

5)Write a function to display first 10 rows and last 10 rows of the records
